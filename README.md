<!-- PROJECT TITLE -->
<div align="center">
<h1 align="center"> Housing Price Predication with Machine Learning </h1>
</div>

Using California census data (1990) to build a mode of housing prices. The data includes
**population**, **median income**, and **median housing price** for each district. The model should
learn from this data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district given
all the other metrics mentioned above.

## Project Checklist

### 1. Establishing the problem frame

- The model outputs (predictions of median housing price for each district) should be able to be fed into another machine learning system.
- The current solution involves manually calculate the median housing prices with complex formula; it is
time-consuming and the estimates are not ideal (off by ~30%).
- Since the inputs are labeled with expected outputs, this is a **supervised learning** task. Moreover, it
is a **regression problem** since the expected outputs are values.
- The model will be trained with **batch learning** since there is no constant update 
of the data, and the data size considerably small.
- The **root-mean-square error (RMSE)** will be used to evaluate the performance of the regression problem since the amount of outlier data are not significant.

### 2. Acquiring the data

- 

### 3. Gaining insight from the data


### 4. Preprocessing the data


### 5. Choosing a model


### 6. Fine-tuning the model


### 7. Presenting the solution


### 8. Launching, monitoring, and maintaining the system
